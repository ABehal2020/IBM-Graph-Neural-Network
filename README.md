# IBM-Graph-Neural-Network

This project is a collabroation between IBM and RCOS. We are working on writing a graph neural network inspired from BonDNet (https://github.com/mjwen/bondnet) to predict x-ray spectroscopic properities in the Lithium-Ion Battery (LIBE) dataset (https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Lithium-Ion_Battery_Electrolyte_LIBE_dataset/14226464).

One Jupyter notebook is an implementation of a graph neural network (GNN) using the Kipf-Welling graph convulational neural (GCN) layers. 

The other Jupyter notebook filters the LIBE dataset to a smaller subset, which is ideal for faster training, validation, and testing purposes of the deep neural networks we are creating.
